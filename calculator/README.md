# Calculator Project

A simple calculator I built to practice JavaScript fundamentals.

## What it does

- Basic math: add, subtract, multiply, divide
- Clear button to reset
- Works with mouse clicks

## Files

- `index.html` - The webpage
- `style.css` - Makes it look good
- `script.js` - Makes it work

## How to run

1. Open `index.html` in any web browser
2. Click the buttons to calculate

## What I learned

- JavaScript event handling
- DOM manipulation
- CSS Grid layout
- Basic math operations in code

That's it! ðŸ§®
